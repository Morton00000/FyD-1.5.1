###[Feed the Beast forum post] (http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/16x-familiar-yet-different-ftb-wip.633/)
***
###Distribution

Anyone can redistribute the texture pack modified or not as long as Greevir and I are given credit.
***
###Usage

If anyone needs help starting on textures feel free to use the pack as a base.

If you do use the pack please let people know and link back to the thread.
***
###Folder Info

This is only the 1.5.1 mod textures folder for the mod folders please see [1.4.7]() or [Templates]().

Currently the mods are being textured seperatly and then placed together for testing/release.
***
###Purpose

The purpose of this is to let people know how I do things.

It is also here to show just how many file/folders/textures need to be made/modifed to make a texture pack.

There are more textures in Minecraft than there are items/blocks in the game.

This 'number' only goes up the more mods that are added.
***
###Other

If you did actualy read all of this make a post about it and leave some feed-back on the forum post.

It is okay to correct my grammer/spelling just don't get overbearing.
