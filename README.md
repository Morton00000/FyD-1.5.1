FyD-1.5.2
=========

The 1.5.2 development files for the Familiar yet Different texture pack.

##[Feed the Beast forum post] (http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/16x-familiar-yet-different-ftb-wip.633/)
***
##Distribution

Anyone can redistribute the texture pack modified or not as long as I am given credit.

This said I have had some help from a few community members such as Greevir and Joe9117.
***
##Usage

If anyone needs help starting on textures feel free to use the pack as a base.

If you do use the pack please let people know and link back to the thread.
***
##Folder Info

This is only the 1.5.X mod textures folder, for the other folders please see [1.6.X](https://github.com/Morton00000/FyD-1.6.X), [1.4.7](https://github.com/Morton00000/FyD-1.4.7), or [Templates](https://github.com/Morton00000/FyD-Template_Files).

Currently the mods are being textured separately and then placed together for testing/release.
***
##Purpose

The purpose of this is to let people know how I do things.

It is also here to show just how many file/folders/textures need to be made/modifed to make a texture pack.

There are more textures in Minecraft than there are items/blocks in the game.

This 'number' only goes up the more mods that are added.
***
##Other

If you did actually read all of this make a post about it and leave some feed-back on the forum post.

It is okay to correct my grammar/spelling just don't get overbearing.

Also a special thanks to Captain Shadows for his help with the build script.
